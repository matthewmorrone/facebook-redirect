# fb-redirect
What does it say about me that I take the time to write chrome extensions in order to focus on the work I actually need to get done (id est, not chrome extensions)?

Automatically redirects you to your messages page whenever you bring up facebook. 
At the moment you can still navigate elsewhere from the messages page because navigation doesn't usually trigger a hard refresh, but, I'm working on it.
